                                Thank you for visiting my WebPage! My name is Joshua Taylor and I am a senior at the University of North 
                                Florida pursuing a bachelor of Science in Computer Science. <br>
                                I have lived the majority of my life in Jacksonville, Florida and I graduated from Duncan U. Fletcher 
                                High School in 2017.<br>
                                While pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science, I gained a love and passion for the fields of mathematics, 
                                physics, computer hardware, computer security, computer networks,<br>
                                computer architecture, and computer programming.Upon completing my current degree I would like to pursue 
                                a masters program in the field of computer hardware.<br>

                <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                <p>Before starting school at UNF I did not have nearly as many hobbies as I do now because my time here at UNF has 
                    allowed me to experience more niche fields of computer science that I can explore and experience on my own. 
                    Thanks to an Introduction to Computer Hardware course I took in the Fall of 2019, I now have an interest in circutis
                    and and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> programming.
                </p>
                <p> While the majority of my hobbies are made up of interests that I have picked up while studying computer science,
                    I also enjoy exercising through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training">strength training</a>
                    with more niche interests in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a> and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifting</a>.
