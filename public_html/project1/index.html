        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a senior computer science student at the University of North Florida pursing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
            I graduated from Duncan U. Fletcher High School in 2017 and started my journey at UNF in the fall of 2018.
            While I initially had very little experience in the Computer Science field besides building my own PC and taking AP Computer
            Science in high school where I learned the basics of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>,
            I quickly grew to love each computer science course more than the previous one.
        </p>
        <p>Some interesting things about myself include that I competed in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu" target="_blank">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a> 
            in high school which then lead to me joining the wrestling team during my junior year in high school. 
            Along with wrestling in high school I also played 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union" target="_blank">Rugby</a> 
            during my freshman year of college.

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <div id="hobby_text1">
            <p>While I played some sports in highschool and college, my main physical hobby today is strength training with specific interests in 
                bodybuilding and powerlifting. Along with strength training, I also like to experiment with circuits and Arduino programming as 
                well as draw and pursue artistic interests. Arduino programming and circuit building is a hobby of mine that I gained after taking
                a course in Computer Hardware at UNF in my junior year that sparked an obsession with the field of Transistor-Transistor Logic and 
                circuit design. Below is pictured an AND gate I made using basic transistors, resistors, push-buttons, an LED, and wires. The circuit
                is powered through the 5 volt output of the Arduino and is grounded using the Ground pin on the same Arduino board.

        <div id="hobby_text2">
            <p>My artistic interests involve both traditional and digital mediums. With traditional tools like graphite pencils, soft core colored
                pencils, and charcoal I like to create portrait drawings as well as anatomical studies of the different bones of the skeleton.
                Through digital painting tools I like to work tattoo designs, floral drawings, and studies of new techniques that I am practicing at
                the time that are aided through the ease of use of digital tools. Below is a picture of the bones of the neorocranium and viscerocranium
                as well as the various bones and sutures that make up the skull.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I have lived in Jacksonville, Florida the majority of my life so after completing elementary and middle school here in Jacksonville I 
            attended Duncan U. Fletcher High School for the entirety of my high school education and graduated in 2017. After graduating I started
            attended the University of North Florida in the Fall 2018 semester with Computer Science as my declared major. After struggling through
            the feelings of imposter syndrome that the majority of computer science students I have spoken to have experienced, I became confident
            and comfortable in my knowledge base enough to participate in the 2019 IEEExtreme Programming Challenge which proved to be an excellent
            gauge of what I needed to learn to improve my knowledge base as a software developer.
        </p>
        <p> Armed with the knowledge of what skills I can improve on, I have created the following list that contains all of the degrees and 
            certifications that I wish to achieve throughout my time at UNF and beyond:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>High School diploma from Duncan U. Fletcher High School</li>
            <li>B.Sc. Computer Science from the University of North Florida</li>
            <li>Professional Full Stack Web Developer - Nanodegree Certification from Udacity</li>
        </ul>
